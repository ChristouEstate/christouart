      <h3>Image No. 1
Untitled (Woman with Strelitzias)
Oil on canvas, approx. 80 × 80 cm
Undated (presumably early 1990s)
</h3>
      <p><strong> At the center of this painting is a female figure, lost in thought, her head resting on her hand. Her gaze seems directed inward, as if reflecting a state of contemplation, sadness, or simply waiting. The strong, warm colors—red, ocher, turquoise, and purple—give the face an ambivalent presence between liveliness and rapture.
Behind her grow two strelitzias, their bright blossoms protruding into the violet-pink background. They appear as symbols of a beauty that is both exotic and vulnerable. In Christou's work, such plants repeatedly appear as metaphors for female self-assertion—for the tension between autonomy, longing, and rootedness.
The composition's expressive colorfulness is reminiscent of late Fauvist tendencies or Paula Modersohn-Becker, but Christou's expression remains more introspective. Here, color is not used for description, but rather as an emotional topography: it shapes identity as a space of sensation.
The picture can be read as a “self-portrait without a self-image”—a painterly reflection on existence between places, languages, and relationships. In the vibrant tension between red and violet, between closeness and distance, an attitude emerges that pervades Christou's biography: a quiet, resistant femininity that finds its language in color.</p>

      <h3>Image No.2 
Untitled (Reclining Nude)
Oil on canvas, approx. 100 × 70 cm
Undated (presumably Marburg phase, late 1980s)
</h3>
      <p></strong> In Alexandra Christou's work, the female nude is not a classical erotic subject, but a place of resistance. This reclining figure—monumental, yet vulnerable and self-assured—does not look at the viewer, but past them. Her body fills the space as if it were a landscape: a topography of red, yellow, blue, and turquoise. Christou paints the body not as an object, but as a field of sensation. The colors seem to glow from the skin, not applied to it. The overlapping of warm and cold zones creates movement—a breathing space between closeness and withdrawal. The arm under the head, the slightly averted posture, and the open gaze create an ambivalence: between self-forgetfulness and consciousness, between invitation and distance.
The figure seems to be at peace with itself, but the image does not radiate tranquility. It is filled with energy, with the inner tension that characterizes Christou's nudes—the body as an expression of the soul's topography. The color red stands not only for sensuality, but also for existence, warmth, and wounds.
This work was probably created during Christou's time in Marburg, when she was working intensively with nude painting—also in confrontation with her own role as a model. The gaze of the picture reverses the classical gaze: it is not the woman who is being looked at, she looks through the viewer. A body that thinks – and declares itself to be space.
Keywords: Female nude, self-perception, body landscape, color as emotion, self-assertion, Marburg phase.

      <h3>Image No.3 
Image No. 3
Sophia (back nude)
Oil on canvas, approx. 80 × 120 cm
Undated (presumably Athens, early 1990s)
</h3>
      <p></strong> This work depicts the artist's daughter—not as a portrait, but as an apparition of body, color, and memory. The figure is shown from behind, slightly turned, one hand on her hip. There is no narrative gesture, no environment, no space to support her: here there are only body, light, pigment.
The colors—an interplay of pink, violet, turquoise, yellow, and ocher—are not skin tones, but emotional registers. The line of the spine, the curve of the hip, the glow of the shoulder blade—all these are signs of vulnerability and strength at the same time.
Here, Christou transforms the closeness of a mother's gaze into painting. The body of the adult daughter is not idealized, but rather, painted tentatively, it is carried by both affection and strangeness. The depiction from behind both protects and reveals: it maintains distance and asserts closeness.
The painting belongs to the transition to the Athens phase, in which Christou began to transform her surroundings—family, neighbors, women she saw—into archetypal figures. Here, a personal relationship becomes a universal theme: the mother's view of her daughter growing up and becoming her own person.
Color replaces language. Closeness is transformed into form.
Keywords: Motherhood, body, memory, closeness and distance, female identity, early 1990s, Athens.
